title: routine
---
I’ve thieved one night’s molten rest and spread it like butter 
across the past 5 and my pants pinched my tummy when i bought
them but slide today down my hips
as I walk because my belt doesn’t fit either, anymore and I miss loving 
my favorite snacks and eating 
anything other than junk food text messages and I miss concern 
over my red eyes in the morning or my fallen hairs 
making a graveyard of the kitchen, and I miss craving
a good sleep and a well-rested wake, I miss seeing 
the sunrise or more than 6 months without my clothes 
forgetting how to fit and I miss missing
my friends and my yarn and my art and my bed,
I miss missing

I hate that these days, my best words evaporate
my more seductive sentences solidifying only as I walk, urgent and profound 
but melted by the time I reach my destination, although I never really reach 
my destination because there isn’t one;
I’m just walking to think and it feels like these days that’s all I do is 
walk and think and walk and think and walk and nothing changes and nothing stays the same and there’s always a new grief and I’m not allowed to use 
the elevator or eat breakfast or put cream in my coffee, all I have time to do is walk and follow my foolish rules and eat my words and panic over the hours passing like my back, cracked, and
think 
and walk and think and walk and I wonder 
if I ever lived rule-less, if I even could; I’ve never tried

I’m nearing my non-destination, my body lacks resolution.
though I don’t fret, I’ll
loiter for a bit
forget myself for a minute, maybe two
until the space in between comes to me sated, almost glutted, calls me to rise and so 
I’ll rise, walk again and think 
up a new empire and fill it with brand new ways to think about the same old things;
I imagine that’s what they call routine.
