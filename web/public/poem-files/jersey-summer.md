think of jersey summer think of flying god incarnate as a kite, free 
as a bird but stable as calcite and steadied by a fertile earth of sweat,
tears, certain mainly innocuous over-waterings that form 
a ground
for a love that had grown at last heavy enough to resist volatility, tall enough to yield 
her first fruit; stability. 

when I think of jersey summer and gliding up erie street and down newark ave to the corner of 10th,  zipping and unzipping that grid at a constant pace, a model mouse in a maze that looks like paradise and I recall, there’s a backdrop
to my memories and that’s what it is, I was a kite.
I don’t feel like a kite anymore though, perhaps that’s why 
I think of it so often.
