I come home from the grocery store and the evening’s grim mouth is 
gagged with anxiety, leaving the air quiet: sunday. 

I put away milk and honey, processed bread, “manager’s choice” turkey 
that will expire tomorrow, black beans and finally, my prize
for  shopping, for working those cursed casino-lit corridors, for taking 
my sister to the orthodontist: raspberries.

just a pint but they are magnificent, vibrant as the pretend ketchup I layer on gas station hot dogs. 
no, vibrant as the blood under my chipped fingernails. 
no, let’s
just say vibrant. 
so I go on, my days now brighter 
with anticipation. I sweep floors, climb walls, hurry 
past the blinding counter with my socks in one hand and soul in the other. I take nights heavy with aching arms, glazed with rest; I take benadryl,
wait. The cracked desert road plateaus, prepares to curve uphill and into raw
refreshing shade: thursday.

on break. happy, or happier. time loiters like asphalt
in a pitch drop.
the clouded plastic reveals berries half melted, adorned in fleecy white and green, pathetically lain in their own decomposition. they look up at me. 

I blink. clench my teeth. extend my hand. let the faint pulse sync with mine for the briefest of moments and then thumb
the slouching bodies down to put them to rest.
press the repulsive, lifeless eyes closed. eyeliner and organs have smudged onto my finger and I look up to find a towel 
but blink again, and see
the counter in front of me now dusted in cobwebs, now sticky with the remains of 
long-forgotten meals, now anything but ashimmer: faith, arrogantly 
mistaken.

so berries rot, hair falls out, shifts are missed but I trust 
in another box on another shining counter on another gloomy day: peace
