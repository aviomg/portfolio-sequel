i love your extravagant double takes
you love to act, you’ll never admit it,
your eyes lower with a lumber hoping to hide that brazilian 
cherry shine

you work a double with the flu, it's fun to act like you’re fine
you ask me why you have to stay alive, and melt 
coldly into my arms when i answer, it’s me
you hold my head close to your left ear and my neck is strained but you need the song of my desire and i need
to give it to you

you eat milk and broken prepositions and past tenses that break my little brain
you slepted in the train, did you? you ate to much?
you think you can hide your ugly intelligence, how sure you are that you are the best one, the
chosen one, the greatest one
in this room?
i see it, i’ve read your letters and heard your
heated words, even when i know that all you want 
to do is strangle me (pinned against a ford excursion, the target parking lot, remember?)
my little brain absorbs your big lies.

if i didn’t know you, i’d worry that maybe that’s all you are in front of me
an act
that you will disappear like the whispers in the attic when i listen too hard
like the exact shade of lime jello green that once sung these nervous 
hands to sleep

but i don’t know you
i know i don’t
i don’t know if i do, i know how it sounds,
i do

when i met you, you were an actor that hated acting and loved living
i know now that you were just a man who hated living,
but loved acting
oh, i wish i could tell you
