title: for guilty pleasures
---
praise for guilty pleasures; like when
our friends invite us for ice cream and she wants to join until I say,
I’m tired, I’ll stay home but you should go
and she doesn’t

for sharp delinquent nails in the summer unleashed
on a bug bite, dead skin slid down skin raw but
eyes rolled up and back
arched

for the occasional healthy narcissism:
friends revealing themselves as lovers,
strangers who remember my name,
men that are creepy
but not quite lethal
all those eyes on my body

for falsities:

like playing a cashier instead of being one
clocking into a new body, 
a new name, accent, back
storied past display for customers arriving
my way

and having friends
our shoulders touching, truth stretched across each one, truth (benevolently)
bent for the girl who sits with us, she’s our friend she really is 
nice, but she’s not invited and she shouldn’t know it and for once I am absolved
of the burden of agency

and all the other lies too
through the teeth, out of the ass, white, black, smoky, woolen, all of them

praise for the propensities of pleasure:
to resist dictation, 
to defend an intensity immutable
by any label; shame simplicity sin guilt or 
some other petty adjective;
praise for this immunity.
