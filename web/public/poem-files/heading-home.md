i’ve never made such a long drive by myself i learned that 
now’s not a good time for me to be alone with my thoughts. i’m not sure 
about the other ones; i never tested it out. 
but today i did. oh boy was it awful. and convivial. it was a party
every moment of this trip that i spent playing another reality—self-inflicted drowning in NPR One, or that ebook on surveillance capitalism; romanticizing my 20 minute cigarette
break at a gas station in southern pennsylvania (ignoring the nausea); throwing my shoulders upwards 
in a dramatic startle each time the sky sent me an SOS, flashes of long, drawn-out white bluntly and briefly revealing the road behind the opaque rain on those last hours of the drive. 

but the self-prescribed dosage-listen of the one song that draws brine across my cheeks and enkindles my primal strength to face utter reality for what feels like running across hot coals on a beach, erroneously perceived infinitely and those other 
moments, the brief intermissions where i’d suddenly and frantically remember the truths, the states of my affair;
(i’m not skilled enough to give those justice in writing)
i did a good job at fending them off, for the most part. out of desire to make it out alive

i have to learn to paint the moments with more muted tones because i don’t want to spend my entire life looking back on them in pain. it always hurts to look back, it’s not a good sign

i can tell how unruly a phase of my life was by the red-hot stamp burned forevermore in my brain 
of the mantra i clung to at the time. ‘don’t want to remember, don’t want to forget’, that was a real bad one. i’m getting that painful nostalgia again, i despise it. i think of the Oasis lyric, ‘don’t look back in anger’ i’d always thought the next line was ‘i know you will’ until i looked up the lyrics a month ago
right now it’s “doors close all the time”, i read that in a kaz moon poem,
im clinging to it tighter than ever before, its a comforting crutch so far but i fear the looming tolerance i will inevitably grow and what i will be obliged to seek out when the time comes

i have this sudden and urgent need for someone to hear me and i never feel this way and frankly it almost concerns me. but then I remember that this too, shall pass
and that doors close all the time
