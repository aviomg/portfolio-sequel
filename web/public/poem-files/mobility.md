sole pink rose, foreshadowing.
last phone call, faltering
in only a color i can’t see, fear
like bleach dripping off the tip of the ice pick
as it unwittingly hedges
its last strike at the glacier (unity.
or glue.) it crumbles, sloshing at a horsefly’s 
frequency -- or maybe it was me 
distractedly playing the fly, imagining mobility
& a life too brief to entertain
consequence, fear, hope, (most of all) change.

nonetheless i did notice it. the next
evening, i noticed a second rose,
keeping her precursor company.
