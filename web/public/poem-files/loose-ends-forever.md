something infectious about this heart
of hearts. to know it is sweet & lazy, eggs sunny-side up & guilty
laughter prologuing the obligatory shake of a head
to love it is to contract. 
something that is at least chronic, and may be permanent but i’m leaning 
towards temporary (temporarily).
copper wires that voice box, the muscles of that face, those tear ducts straight
into my heart. this is uncharted territory

prologuing, prolonging, wondering if i’ll see our epilogue; wondering if i’ll always want one. 
knowing that this pencil has far less to do with them than with me; writing with it anyways.
