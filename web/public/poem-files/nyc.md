there are no hippies in new york city
no dirt white knits over hemp starred skirts
and proud exposed bellies
no, not in the manner of bikinis burning on beaches
or sleek shirts cut just short of taut belly buttons;
i went to new york city in december

hippie bellies are exposed in that they are 
shown
shown down shown off never ever shown up
they are round and proud and uncaring
hippie bellies don’t know that they exist
hippie bellies are attached to angled minds preoccupied by
matching patterns with patterns 
with cashew cheese and non-profit thrift stores 
and beads and the long 
line of injustices hoarded by the world
hippie bellies know that they don’t owe no one
an explanation
hippie bellies will fight you and beat you
hippie bellies guide moral compasses sharper than the high 
heels that hippie feet don’t wear and hippie arms will fight you 
and beat you if said compass points them so but alas
there are no hippies in new york city
there are no bellies
in new york city
only stomachs, only abs and ribs and the most occasional tummy
only sleek, vintage tops from shein,
puffy jackets for small waists and h&m girls
only pantsuits, small chunky hoops, short black boots

i wish for more hippies in new york city; they know how to bring 
the sunshine and i hope that one day, I can be a hippie in new york 
city too
