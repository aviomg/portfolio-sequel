this is what I think every time you plunge your lips in a purse and stack your teeth to throw a “shhh” at me. i think, how do I tell you that my world is filled with noise, that I am filled with noise, that I want to be the speakerphone and the bluetooth radio and the air bouncing from mountain to fog-capped mountain in harmonious chant, the melted sugar of a mother’s voice and
the hyena’s cackle and the tone commanding
your laugh?
that my organs long to echo, my voice alive at their mercy
I’ve been thinking, what is the sound of a smile?
If your eyes are closed and I’m laying underneath 
your breath but I want you to know that I’m smiling then I need you to first hear me
I need you to see that I am never quiet, I’m made
of noise, I hope
