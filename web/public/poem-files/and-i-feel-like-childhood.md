I’m reading a book all cozy in my dorm room bed and I feel free like
Childhood, when you get sent home sick from school and your mother makes you
Lie down and rubs your back so you fall asleep but you don’t;
you steady your breathing, relax your eyelids, let your mouth fall slightly
parted and nearly forget that it’s all for show,
but you don’t, you cling desperately to consciousness until she finally leaves, 
satisfied, perhaps hoping you stay asleep, but ultimately indifferent so long you don’t interrupt her day again and now finally.
you can sit up and read a book with just the 1pm sun climbing through the window, with your phone “taken away” by your mother, as if you were anything other than grateful
to be rid of it.
and you are finally alone in the world. and the cookies from your lunch box
taste so much better in secret
and you could almost stay this way forever.
