title: maybe i don’t mind the rain - January 2023
---
(i wrote this about my roomate/favorite person in the world)

being friends with her is like knowing 
a new peace; of moving to a gloomy and storm-ridden town with the expectation
that your shelter will be rare but that
when you have it,
you will savor it. 
instead, you are surprised to realize two
things. 

one, just how much you adore the rain; how you cherish it, to coexist with 
it, to let it hang on your skin and dilute your worries;
the unexpected discovery of an ultimate, impossible comfort in its presence.

and two, 
the way that it doesn’t rain enough. 
the way that there are too many sunny weekends, days dictated by 
suffocation and nights charged with nerves where the room,
already so humid and dense, 
does not have space for all those
pitch black thoughts and in the heat they ruminate, 
they ripen, the room starts to smell until
the rain is back and like magic,
the air clears. she comes back and
the multitudes of skeletons that carpet the floor are instantly
put to rest. pure sorcery! she must be a witch, there is no other conclusion.

and each time the clouds clear and 
the sidewalk dries, you think you will enjoy this 
much needed 
break, 
a chance to dry off, to be alone;
but you dread it. 
because the rain, you see now, has changed you for 
the better and there is nothing you desire more than to be back in your little 
shelter,
watching some irrelevant t.v. show or microwaving nachos or fixing 
your closet or doing your eyeliner,
and hearing the sound of her precious, rhythmic raindrops in the background.
